What is Climate Programmatically?

Climate Programmatically is a location-aware weather app that is done programmatically without the use of storyboards. 
It will find out where you are in the world and query an open source weather service to 
retrieve the temperature and weather conditions. 
Also, you can change the city at the tap of a button in order to answer such questions as  "Want to know what itâ€™s like in Rio?".
